Imagine that you want to simulate a fluid mixture that is
phase-separating. For scientific reasons you may be interested in some
statistical properties of this process, but how can you be sure that
the program is really doing what you expect it to do? And what do you
do if you want to find out what the effect of different parameters is?
There will often be quite a few different parameters that you need to
control. 

<P>
My vision for this library is that it will help scientists to
transform their simulations which are performing their instruction in
a way that is hard to observe, into a transparent object where you can
look at all times at the relevant variables and where you can change
the parameters to see what will happen. This changes the nature of
computational research: suddenly you are able to see and manipulate
the system you simulate directly. You will now be able to see what is
going on in the system, and if something does behave differently than
you expect you have probably found a bug in your program and you can
eliminate it faster. And if it isn't a bug you have just learned
something interesting about the system. And once in a while you will
be the first to notice and you have made a discovery that you might
not have made without being able to observe the system so
closely (this is what happened to me a lot of the time).

<P>
This is not to suggest that you give up the more traditional approach
of defining curves for which you can make analytical predictions or
which you can compare to experiments. But I feel that it is a very
valuable extension of this approach.
