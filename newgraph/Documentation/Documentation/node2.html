History</A>
</H1>
In my first year as a physics student at Bielefeld
University in 1992, I met Johannes Schlosser. What began as a study group
for physics problems soon developed into a great friendship and an
intense and fruitful collaboration on exploring what computers could
do.

<P>
At this time a computer would be in ``text mode'' as standard and only
for special problems would a ``graphics mode'' be activated. At this
time only Apple computers broke with this paradigm and Microsoft was
only a small company making the Microsoft DOS as well as a few text
programs. A graphics resolution of 600:300 was a great resolution and
color was a luxury we could not afford. We each bought an 8068 IBM
compatible computer and began checking out what we could do with
it. Switching the monochrome Hercules graphics card into graphics mode
was a major challenge. We started using Turbo Pascal as our
programming language of choice with a few Assembler inline additions.

<P>
But seeing the graphics on the screen is rather fleeting, so we
also wanted to be able to print it. There was the option of a screen
print, but that meant limiting the print output to the low resolution
of the screen, even though I had invested in an NEC P6c, a color dot
printer. So we wanted to make sure that we could print out our
graphics with maximal resolution and in color on our printer. But how
can you transfer a picture from the screen to the printer and increase
the resolution? The solution we found was to have two sets of basic
graphic routines: one would write to the screen, the other would write
to a set of memory which was a bitmap of what we would then write to
the printer. We realized that if you wrote your program so that all
sizes would be relative to the X and Y dimensions of your medium, they
would look right, no matter if they would be printed on a screen or
printed to the printer.

<P>
On this level, we managed to program a graphical user interface which
was supposed to be easy to adapt for new programs. If you wanted to
print something you could use the same routines that you had used to create
your graphics on the screen. It came as a total revelation to us when,
a few years later, Peter Seroka introduced us to the X windows system
common on Unix workstations. Being able to open windows on other
computers seemed like a little miracle to us. A little earlier Linus
Torwald had developed the Linux kernel and now the first working
versions of the Linux operating systems became available and they were
free! Another revelation there. So with the help of Linux (version
0.92, I believe) we could transform our computers (80286 IBM
compatibles at this time) into Unix workstations. 

<P>
This signaled the change from Pascal to C (which only our friend Tim
Scheideler was using at the time) and X windows for our graphics
needs. Previously all printing was different for all printers, but the
people of Adobe Inc. had developed PostScript, a portable graphics
language. And with the help of ghostscript you could (and still can)
print any postscript file on any printer. So we decided to now use
PostScript files as the output which could then be printed
<I>everywhere</I>. 

<P>
At this time both Johannes and myself were working on our
Diplomarbeit (masters thesis) at Bielefeld University. Not
surprisingly, we were both doing computational projects and were
heavily relying on graphical output. At this point we had
actually developed two separate graphics libraries. Johannes had true
three-dimensional capabilities whereas I had developed basic menus,
the printer support, and coordinate systems. Because Johannes was the
much more organized of the two of us we used the structure of this
graphics library and added my extensions into his code to create what
remains to this day the basic foundation of the library: a set of
basic two dimensional graphics routines which interface either xlib of
the X windows system or PostScript routines, a library for the
representation of three dimensional scenarios. This was supported by a
set of menu functions that dealt with mouse interactions.

<P>
After we successfully used the graphics libraries for our Diplomarbeit
Johannes went on to a rapidly advancing career at IBM Deutschland
whereas I went on to graduate school at Oxford. For my graduate work
I picked a numerical project again, but this time I dealt with complex
fluids which needed a number of different representations that our
graphics library did not yet support. I included support for density
plots and contour lines, but whenever I wrote a new program I still
copied lots of old code from the last programs to reuse them in the
new programs. And then I realized that anytime I copied code from other
programs, it meant that it should be part of the library and not part
of the user code. It took quite a few numbers of iterations to reduce
the amount of code the user had to write to use the graphics code. 

<P>
In 1998, at the end of my D.Phil.&nbsp;(Ph.D.), I considered briefly
founding a company for simulating complex fluids and using the
graphics as a part of this commercial enterprise. But I soon realized
that my heart was with science and I did not enjoy the prospects of
meeting with venture capitalists to fund my software company (and that
was at the beginning of the Internet bubble). Instead, I continued my
academic career with postdoctoral positions at MIT and Edinburgh
University. At each of these places I realized that scientists as a
whole don't tent to have easy access to the data in their computer
simulations and that the approach I had taken was quite unique.

<P>
Now I have a faculty position at North Dakota State University and I
want to give you the ability to steer your computer simulations and to
monitor them closely. Considering how much Johannes and I have
benefited from the free software project we have decided to release
our library under the GNU public license to make sure that it is
available for free to anyone.
