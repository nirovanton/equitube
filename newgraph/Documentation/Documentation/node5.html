Say you want to write a code that solves the one-dimensional diffusion
equation with periodic boundary conditions. Don't worry if you don't
understand this particular problem. It is just a specific example of a
computational problem that you might have. Understanding the details
of this is not important in order to follow the main points of this
section. The diffusion equation is given by

You can model this equation by writing a small lattice Boltzmann
program. You could use many other ways, but lattice
Boltzmann is close to my heart. If you are interested in the details
of this algorithm you can find an explanation in appendix
<A HREF="node11.html#1d_diff_LB">B</A>.  Your program<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot211"><SUP>1</SUP></A> might look something like
this:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#define size 100
static Repeat=1000;
static double f0[size],f1[size],f2[size], omega=1, T=0.3;

void init(){
  int i;
  double density;
  for (i=0;i&lt;size;i++){
    density=(2+sin(2*M_PI*i/size));
    f0[i]=density*(1-T);
    f1[i]=density*T*0.5;
    f2[i]=density*T*0.5;
  }
}

void iterate(){
  int i;
  double density,tmp1,tmp2;

    f1[i]+=omega*(density*T*0.5-f1[i]);
    f2[i]+=omega*(density*T*0.5-f2[i]);

  }
  f1[0]=tmp1;
  f2[size-1]=tmp2;

int main(){

  return 0;

This is a very simple program which currently only consists of the
main computational kernel. It does not ``do'' anything yet, since
it has no output. It has been my general experience that the actual
computation can usually be written in a succinct bit of code whereas
the analysis and output make up the main part of the code. And this
analysis tends to be so individual that there is little guidance in
how to write this bit of the code. 

<P>
Now we want to see what the code actually does. So we would like to
see what the density is at each new time step and how it evolves. We
might want to be able to re-initialize the simulation and maybe to
initialize it with different initial conditions. Also, we might want to
be able to change the size of the simulation. And on the fly, we might
want to be able to change the diffusion constant which in this
simulation is <!-- MATH
 $\kappa=(1/\omega-0.5)T$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$\kappa=(1/\omega-0.5)T$">. So we might want to change the
two parameters independently so that we can examine how the numerical
errors differ for the two approaches.

<P>
This may sound like quite a laborious task, but this is exactly what the
mygraph library was designed to do. What we have to do is to tell the
library which data we want to look at, give it some hints about its
size, and it will be able to display it appropriately. We will also
need a few other control variables to be able to tell the program that
it should pause, run for only one step at a time, or that it should
re-initialize. So this program, with a full graphical user interface
(GUI),<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot212"><SUP>2</SUP></A> would look like this:  
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;mygraph.h&gt;

#define SIZE 100
static int size=SIZE,Repeat=1000,done=0,sstep=0,pause=1;
static double f0[SIZE],f1[SIZE],f2[SIZE], omega=1, T=0.3,Amplitude=1;
static double density[SIZE];
static int densityreq=0;


void init(){
  int i;
  for (i=0;i&lt;size;i++){
    density[i]=(2+Amplitude*sin(2*M_PI*i/size));
    f0[i]=density[i]*(1-T);
    f1[i]=density[i]*T*0.5;
    f2[i]=density[i]*T*0.5;
  }
}

void init2(){
  int i;
  for (i=0;i&lt;size;i++){
    if (2*i&gt;=size) density[i]=2+Amplitude; else density[i]=2-Amplitude;
    f0[i]=density[i]*(1-T);
    f1[i]=density[i]*T*0.5;
    f2[i]=density[i]*T*0.5;

void GUI(){
  DefineGraphN_R("Density",density,&amp;size,&amp;densityreq);
  StartMenu("GUI",1);
    DefineDouble("T",&amp;T);
    DefineDouble("omega",&amp;omega);
    StartMenu("Restart",0);
      DefineMod("size",&amp;size,SIZE+1);

    DefineBool("Pause",&amp;pause);
    DefineBool("Single step",&amp;sstep);
    DefineInt("Repeat",&amp;Repeat);    DefineBool("Done",&amp;done);
  EndMenu();
}

int main(){
  int i;
  init();
  GUI();
  while (!done){
    Events(1); /* Whenever there are new data the argument of 
		  Events() should be nonzero. This will set the
		  requests for data so that you can calculate them
		  on demand only. For this simple program you can
		  always set it to one. */
    DrawGraphs();
    if (!pause || sstep){
      sstep=0;
      for (i=0;i&lt;Repeat;i++) iterate();
    } else {
      sleep(1);/*when the program is waiting it returns the 
		 CPU time to the operating system */
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
</PRE>
Let us go briefly through the new additions to the program which
implement the GUI. The function <TT>GUI()</TT> tells the graphical
user interface about the data to display and the variables we want to
be able to change interactively. Firstly we have the one-dimensional
density field that we want to display. This data gives for a
section of the natural numbers <TT>N</TT> one real number
<TT>R</TT>. The function that tells the GUI about this is
<PRE>
  DefineGraphN_R("Density",density,&amp;size,&amp;densityreq);
</PRE>
The first argument is a string which corresponds to the name of the
data as it will appear in the menus. The second argument is the data
you want to display. More exactly, it is a pointer to the first
element in the array. The third argument is a pointer to a variable
giving the size of the data. We use a pointer rather than simply a
number because if the size of the data changes during the simulation (and
this change is reflected in a change of the variable <TT>size</TT>)
the GUI will know about this and display the data
correctly.
Also note that we made the density an array, not just a temporary
variable of the iterate routine, so that we can display it.

<P>
Then we start the menu for the GUI.
<PRE>
  StartMenu("GUI",1);
</PRE>
The first argument is the name of the menu, and the second argument is
either 0 or 1. If it is 1 this indicates that the menu will be
initially displayed. Since this is the first menu, it should certainly
be displayed. Next we define two <TT>double</TT> variables as menu
items
<PRE> 
    DefineDouble("T",&amp;T);
    DefineDouble("omega",&amp;omega);
</PRE>
These functions have two arguments: the name as it appears in the menu
and the address of the variable. We now define a sub-menu with a new
<TT>StartMenu()</TT> function as above.
<PRE>
    StartMenu("Restart",0);
      DefineMod("size",&amp;size,SIZE+1);
      DefineDouble("Amplitude",&amp;Amplitude);
      DefineFunction("Restart sin",&amp;init);
      DefineFunction("Restart step",&amp;init2);
    EndMenu();
</PRE>
There are three new routines: 
<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD><TT>DefineMod("size",&amp;size,SIZE+1)</TT> inserts a menu item for
  the variable size and only allows it to vary from <TT>0</TT> to
  <TT>SIZE</TT>. 
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><TT>DefineFunction()</TT> allows you to
start functions which don't have any arguments to be called at the
press of a button. The first argument of this function is again the
name as it appears in the menu and the second is the address of the
function you want to be able to call. Note that we introduced a second
initialization routine that initializes the density as a step function
to make things a bit more interesting.
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><TT>EndMenu()</TT> tells the GUI that this is the end of the
sub-menu.
</DD>
</DL>
Next we have a special menu item to display line graphs.
<PRE>
    DefineGraph(curve2d_,"Density");
</PRE>
The routine that does this is <TT>DefineGraph()</TT>. The first
argument of this function is an integer that is represented by the name
<TT>curve2d_</TT>.<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot216"><SUP>3</SUP></A> 
The rest of the GUI implementation should now be self-explanatory.
<PRE>
    DefineBool("Pause",&amp;pause);
    DefineBool("Single step",&amp;sstep);
    DefineInt("Repeat",&amp;Repeat);    
    DefineBool("Done",&amp;done);
  EndMenu();
</PRE>

<P>
After we have successfully initialized the GUI there are two more
library functions that you have to be aware of. Firstly
<PRE>
    Events(1);
</PRE>
For any program with a graphical user interface you have to give the
library functions a chance to react to mouse and keyboard events. It
is this routine that does it. So you have to make sure that you call 
<TT>Events()</TT><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot217"><SUP>4</SUP></A>regularly so that windows can be redrawn, resized and mouse clicks can
be acted upon. The second routine is 
<PRE>
    DrawGraphs();
</PRE>
This routine will draw all the graphs that have need to be
displayed.<A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot218"><SUP>5</SUP></A>One other consideration to keep in mind is that interacting with a
user is slow. So you really don't want to call the <TT>Events()</TT>
routine too often because that would make your program slow.

<P>
Now I just want to make a few more remarks about some useful steering
parameters that I tend to use for simulations. We want to be able to
stop the calculations temporarily to look at the data in leisure,
to be able to step through the calculation one iteration at the time and
to re-initialize the calculation. And we want to be able to quit the
computation at the press of a button. So we define the variables
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">variable</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=227>description</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><TT>done</TT></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=227>this is equal to 0 until the simulation is finished</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><TT>pause</TT></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=227>this is equal to 0 unless the simulation is paused</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><TT>sstep</TT></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=227>this variable gets set to one to run the simulation
for a single step</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><TT>Repeat</TT></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=227>this variable is set to the number of steps that the
simulation should be run until the <TT>Events()</TT> function is
called again</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
With this explanation of the variables the logic of the main routine
should be obvious.
<PRE>
  while (!done){
    Events(1);
    DrawGraphs();
    if (!pause || sstep){
      sstep=0;
      for (i=0;i&lt;Repeat;i++) iterate();
    } else {
      sleep(1);/*when the program is waiting it returns the 
                 CPU time to the operating system */
    }
  }
</PRE>
The only other comment I want to make is regarding the
<TT>sleep(1)</TT> statement. This routine takes control away from the
program and gives it to the operating system. Why would you want to do
this? This is mainly a question of consideration for others and for
any of your own programs that might be running at the same
time. Without this statement the program would always use all the CPU
cycles it can get its hands on, even if it is doing nothing else than
waiting for any input you might want to give it. And while it is
waiting, it might as well give some time to programs that really
need it.
